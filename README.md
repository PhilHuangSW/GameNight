# **Game Night!**
A web application used to store and share your board game collection. 

## **Motivation**
This is a passion project for me. I love board games and having a place where I can keep my collection up to date would be invaluable. Being able to browse my collection and filter only by player count (amongst other filters) will allow me to quickly pick out a game suitable for friends to play.

## **Description**
Game Night allows you to add board games to your personal collection and edit details on them that specify your needs. You will be able to filter through various means such as game title, player count, game length, and theme. 

Game Night will also allow you to create a session where you may host a "Game Night" and give you a "Tinder" view of your board game collection. This session will allow players to view games in your collection tailored to your player count. Players may then swipe left and right on which games they would like to play, and, if there is a common match between everyone, that will be your game to play!
